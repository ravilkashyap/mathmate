I didn\u0027t like the subject a lot before coming here, but I honestly fell in love with math after a few classes. I started to enjoy doing the subject. Very encouraging and friendly environment. Teaching method is creative.",

She gives less teaching and lots of homework. She enters into personal matters. She leaves us late and doesn\u0027t not understand if we have some work.\n\nThanks for reading and don\u0027t join.\n\nThe 2 reviews down r given by her itself.  So doesn\u0027t deserve 4.4 out of 5.",

      "comment": "I deeply regret that things didn\u0027t work out for you.\n\nI have taken your feedback about homework but the mantra for excelling in mathematics is to practice practice and practice!! Along with unique ways of teaching, it is important to solve problems related to that concept regularly to strengthen the understanding of the concept!\n\nI care about my students and always hope the best for them. If there is anything the students want to talk about, I am always available for them. I do not intend to be involved in any personal matters.\n\nThe 2 reviews are given by my own children for whom I have taught mathematics and I am proud that they have done well.\n\nMy aim as a teacher is to not only to teach the subject mathematics but also to inculcate the moral values through my teaching.",
